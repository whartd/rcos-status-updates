## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I learned a lot about the project's structure. I spent a while understanding the code in two plugins (ground items and barbarian assault). I found a ticket related to both plugins that I'd like to work on, (#6026)[https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/6026].

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> I plan on figuring out how to modify the behavior of the ground items overlay plugin using the barbarian assault plugin without changing the code in the ground items overlay plugin for issue 6026 
> I plan on finding other more simple issues to work on

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to find previous commits or existing code that will help me with my first goal for this week. If not I may need to reach out to someone through their discord.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
