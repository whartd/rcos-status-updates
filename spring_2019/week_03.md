Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I ended up stumped trying to solve issue 6026, and decided that working on other parts of the project might teach me skills that will help me with that later. I identified a problems that I would like to work on and which I think may be simple. I took screenshots of these which I plan to include in this file in a later commit. I done preliminary scans of the code I expect to be related.
This Week's Plan
This week I plan to search for the problems I have identified in the existing list of issues. If no issue exists for a problem I plan to create one. This will require me to further explore the code related to each of the issues. 
Anything Blocking?
I don't currently know the process of creating a new issue, but I don't foresee this being a blocker.
