Last Week's Accomplishments
This week I managed to find a pull request related to something I was working on, find the contributor's repository, and create a local clone of their branch to play around with. This can be seen in my branch https://github.com/whartd/runelite/tree/highlight-egg-colors. I have been going through this code and seeing how it could be used to complete the rest of https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/6026, the issue I mentioned I was working on last week.
This Week's Plan
I plan on trying to use the branch I found to finish issue 6026. The branch I found highlights egg colours in the context menu, and I hope to also highlight egg colours in the ground items overlay.
What's Blocking?
I don't see any significant, identifiable blocks this week.
